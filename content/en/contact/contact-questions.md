#### How many days a week is the program?     

We teach every Sunday, so one day a week. During the week we expect you to do your homework with online support from our teachers and your fellow students. We expect you to study a minimum of 25 hours per week.   

#### Do you cover travel expenses to the class in Amsterdam?  

Yes, we cover all train-travel expenses to Amsterdam for the duration of the whole program.   

#### Do I need a background in IT and coding in order to apply?      

No, we start with the basics of programming. More important than your background is your work ethic and ability to work in a team.

#### How much do I need to pay?     

If you are selected to join our course, you do not pay anything. We can pay for your training because we are generously supported by the ING Fonds and Stichting DOEN. We also ask companies where we place our students a ‘placement fee’. Finally, our teachers are all teaching on a voluntary basis, which reduces our costs.   

#### What are my chances of finding a job, after finishing the program?     

Currently around 95% of our graduates find work after finishing the program. However, to finish our program is a major challenge and will require a lot of hard work and effort. 

#### What do you look for in students?      

Students need to be comfortable speaking and reading in English, as this our language of communication. In addition, students need to be very motivated to start a career as a programmer and willing to work very hard.   

#### How do our graduates find jobs?   

We have a large network of companies ready to hire junior developers. After graduation we introduce our students to these companies, and if there is a match, they can start their programming career. We also help our students to find employment opportunities themselves.   Often our students start with an internship at a company, and then start their first job after a few months. Our alumni currently work for large companies like Booking.com, KLM, Apple, Wehkamp and for smaller companies like Owlin, Zivver and Faktor.
