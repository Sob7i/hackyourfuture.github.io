# HackYourFuture teaches software development to refugees

The demand for talented software developers is growing rapidly. Yet many people who have left their country involuntarily are unable to use their abilities, lacking access to training and professional networks. 

We put that potential to good use. Training refugees in computer programming significantly boosts their chances of fulfilling, long-term employment, whilst increasing the number of developers on the job market. That’s a win-win situation.
