# How our school works

Our coding school teaches a 6-month full-stack web development program. The curriculum is created and taught by our volunteer network of over forty professional developers. They share not only their skills, but also their networks, insights into working life and up-to-date knowledge of the ever-changing tech sector. 

Our students learn the fundamentals of full-stack web-development, with a focus on modern JavaScript. Our students aren’t just taught the mechanics of coding; they learn how to work on projects in a modern tech team, how to be problem-solvers. They learn to think like developers.

HackYourFuture teaches every Sunday. We pay for students’ travel, so our students can join us from all over the country. In addition to our in-person teaching sessions, we coach and support our students online throughout the week. Over the course of 6 months, our students benefit from industry visits, masterclasses from tech experts, and individual career-coaching.
