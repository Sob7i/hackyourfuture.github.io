# Results until today

Our measure of success is simple - do our graduates find a job? Therefore our selection process is rigorous and the program is tough; not everyone who starts our course graduates. After finishing the program, we guide our students towards employment through our network of tech professionals.

Our approach is working: 96% of our graduates have gone on to secure employment, with the rest going into further study.
