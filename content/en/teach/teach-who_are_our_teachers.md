# who are our teachers 

All our volunteer teachers are skilled developers, with multiple years’ experience, who teach in their free time on weekends and in evenings. Our teachers come from a range companies, from start-ups to major corporations. We like to refer to our volunteers as ‘teacher-mentors’, as they provide support, guidance, and advice to our students in addition to technical content.
