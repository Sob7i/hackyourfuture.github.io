# what it means to be a teacher

Most of our teachers commit to teaching in-person for four hours each Sunday. Our curriculum is organised into modules (topics) of three weeks each, so teachers are typically assigned to teach in three-week periods together with another volunteer, as well as providing feedback on studentsâ€™ homework for their module. Every module consists of readings, videos and practical assignments. But we are always open to suggestions, regarding the content as well as our teaching methods and continuously ask for feedback from students and teachers.  Our teachers also occasionally engage in online Q&A sessions on weekday evenings. During the week students can ask questions in Slack, with over 70 skilled developers on stand-by, ready to answer their questions.
