The core language we teach is JavaScript. Our students learn: 

HTML, CSS, Command Line, Git, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, MySQL and MongoDB

Aside from technology, we also want our students to learn how to think like a programmer by solving problems and teamwork. These fundamental skills prepare our students for their first jobs as web developers. 

The curriculum we use has been written by our volunteers, who reflect the changing demands of the current tech job market with their academic and professional experience in software development. The curriculum is reviewed and refined after every class - as of now, that's over a dozen times.Â Our curriculum developed collaboratively as an open-source project, and is used by four other European coding schools, who helped us refine it. Anybody - teachers, students, or a random contributor - can open an issue or pull request to suggest improvements.
