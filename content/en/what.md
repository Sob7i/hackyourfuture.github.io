# HackYourFuture trains refugees to become full-stack software developers. 

Our coding school teaches a 6-month web development program to refugees with or without a background in coding. The curriculum is created and taught by our volunteer network of over forty professional developers. They teach our students how to work on projects in a modern tech team. How to be problem-solvers. At HackYourFuture, students learn to think like developers. 

Training refugees in computer programming significantly boosts their chances of fulfilling, long-term employment. Plus, it fills a gap on the job market. Everyone wins.

Our approach works: 96% of our graduates have gone on to find jobs in the tech industry.
